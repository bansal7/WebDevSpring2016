<h1>Welcome to SplitUp !</h1>
<p class="justifiedpara">
<p>As college students ourselves, bills, bills and more bills are always given and yet,
    we never could find a way to track them, split them and sort them out quickly and conveniently.
    Eventually I decided that the only way to find a solution was to design and develop one myself.</p>
<p> This Web app is simple and very useful for many people,
    especially students to roam and party freely without tracking of whom they are owing and who is owing them,
    in one application. After all, everyone has bills to pay and at one time or another needs to split them.
    So I hope this web application will make your life a little easier!
